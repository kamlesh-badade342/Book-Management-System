# Book-Management-System
∗ Created a user-interactive website showcasing various book categories available in the library, with options to edit or delete entries. ∗ Implemented a recommendation system that predicts ratings or preferences, catering to user needs and tastes. We have used NodeJS and Express for back-end and HTML/CSS and ReactJS for front-end development.
